# Objectives
- [ ] Add external potential to SAPT(DFT):
    - [x] issue with clone of molecule clearing \_initial\_geometry attribute needed for external potential in scf_helper:
        - energies are now different from dimer and monomer SCF's, getting closer but need to explicitly include in SAPT terms
    - [ ] ELST - manual implementation
    - [ ] EXCH - 
    - [ ] INDU
    - [ ] 
- [ ] Derive FSAPT for SAPT(DFT) equations. Maybe there are algorithm choices
        for FSAPT implementation that are actually faster?
- [ ]
