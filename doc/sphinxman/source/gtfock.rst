Interface to GTFock by E. Chow *et al.*

GTFock is a distributed-memory Fock-build engine: it partitions the AO matrix
across MPI ranks, evaluates two-electron integrals with
:ref:`Simint <sec:simint>`, and accumulates the Coulomb and exchange
contributions into distributed matrices. |PSIfour| can use it as an alternative
:term:`SCF_TYPE <SCF_TYPE (SCF)>`, ``GTFOCK``, in place of its own Libint2-based
J/K builders.

.. warning:: This is a **prototype**. It proves the Python |w---w| MPI |w---w|
   GTFock path end to end; it is not a production distributed SCF driver. The
   restrictions in `Prototype scope`_ are enforced with explicit errors rather
   than left to produce wrong numbers.

GTFock is entirely optional. A default |PSIfour| configure, build, ``import
psi4``, and test run neither requires nor loads GTFock, Simint, MPI, or mpi4py.

Prototype scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **One density matrix per Fock build**, i.e. closed-shell RHF. GTFock's
  GTMatrix-backed engine keeps a single global density matrix, so open-shell and
  multi-density work (UHF, ROHF, SOSCF, response) raise rather than run.
* **Cartesian basis sets only** (``puream false``). GTFock's Simint driver fills
  Cartesian shell blocks while GTFock sizes a basis it labels spherical as
  :math:`2l+1` per shell. The counts diverge above ``l = 1``, and even at
  ``l = 1`` the orderings differ |w---w| Simint lays a ``p`` shell out as
  ``px, py, pz`` while |PSIfour| orders pure shells by :math:`m` |w---w| so a
  spherical basis would give a permuted J/K. Any spherical basis raises,
  including an ``s``/``p``-only one such as the default spherical ``sto-3g``.
* **No range-separated exchange.** ``wK`` is unavailable from GTFock.
* **One engine per process.** GTFock caches the basis, the Simint handle, and
  its screening and blocking buffers in global state that it fills once and
  never refreshes, so |PSIfour| builds a single GTFock engine and reuses it.
  Asking for a second engine with a different molecule, basis, or task shape in
  the same process raises; run that case in a fresh process.
* **Screening is more conservative than the requested tolerance.**
  ``INTS_TOLERANCE`` (equivalently ``jk.set_cutoff()``) is handed to GTFock
  verbatim as its ``tolscr``, but GTFock stores ``tolscr * tolscr`` and compares
  that against a Schwarz bound on the integral, whereas |PSIfour| documents
  ``INTS_TOLERANCE`` as the absolute magnitude below which a TEI is neglected.
  A requested tolerance of :math:`t` therefore screens at :math:`t^2`, so GTFock
  always discards fewer integrals than asked. That costs time, not accuracy.
* J and K are gathered on rank 0 and broadcast, so every rank holds the full
  matrices. Distributing the SCF itself is later work.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Source only.** GTFock has no conda package. Build it from the ``gtfock_psi4``
superproject, which pins GTFock, GTMatrix, libcint, OptErd, and the Simint
generator, and builds them with conda-forge IntelLLVM (``icx``/``icpx``) plus
OpenMPI.

.. note:: Build |PSIfour| with the **same OpenMP runtime** GTFock uses.
   conda-forge's ``icx`` links ``libomp``; if |PSIfour| were built with GCC it
   would link ``libgomp``, and GTFock's ``omp_get_thread_num()`` could bind to
   the wrong runtime and corrupt its per-thread integral buffers. Building
   |PSIfour| with the same IntelLLVM compilers, as below, keeps one OpenMP
   runtime in the process.

.. code-block:: bash

    # (1) environment: Psi4's build/run dependencies plus gtfock_psi4's build
    #     contract (IntelLLVM, OpenMPI, MKL) plus mpi4py.
    >>> conda env create -n p4gtf -f devtools/conda-envs/linux-64-gtfock.yaml --solver libmamba
    >>> conda activate p4gtf

    # (2) build GTFock. GTF_COMBINED_JK=OFF is required: with the default ON,
    #     GTFock folds exchange into its Fock matrix and Psi4's JK object can
    #     never recover K on its own.
    >>> git clone --recursive https://github.com/Awallace3/gtfock_psi4.git
    >>> cd gtfock_psi4
    >>> CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=12 ./build_deps.sh --clean
    >>> cmake -S . -B _build/gtfock -DGTF_COMBINED_JK=OFF
    >>> cmake --build _build/gtfock --parallel 12
    >>> cmake --install _build/gtfock          # populates ./_install
    >>> cd ..

    # (3) configure and build Psi4 against that install
    >>> conda/psi4-path-advisor.py cache --compiler IntelLLVM --lapack mkl --objdir objdir_gtfock
    >>> # comment out the CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER line in the generated cache file:
    >>> #   Psi4's superbuild forwards it verbatim, and the conda ifx wrapper is a
    >>> #   multi-argument list. No Fortran add-on is enabled here, so it is unused.
    >>> cmake -S. -GNinja -C"cache_p4gtf@gtfock.cmake" -Bobjdir_gtfock \
    ...       -DENABLE_GTFock=ON \
    ...       -DGTFock_ROOT=/path/to/gtfock_psi4/_install \
    ...       -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/gtfock_psi4/_install;${CONDA_PREFIX}" \
    ...       -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES="${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libmkl_intel_lp64.so;${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libmkl_intel_thread.so;${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libmkl_core.so" \
    ...       -DLAPACK_INCLUDE_DIRS="${CONDA_PREFIX}/include" \
    ...       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install-psi4-gtfock
    >>> cmake --build objdir_gtfock -j 12

``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` must include the GTFock install prefix because Simint is
installed there too, alongside ``libgtfock``.

``-DLAPACK_LIBRARIES`` must name MKL's *layered* libraries rather than letting
|PSIfour| pick ``libmkl_rt``. GTFock links MKL's BLACS and ScaLAPACK, whose
internal symbols (``mkl_serv_verbose_mode`` and friends) live in
``libmkl_core`` and are not exported by the ``libmkl_rt`` dispatcher. A plain
executable gets away with that through lazy binding, but Python dlopens
``core.so`` with ``RTLD_NOW``, so every symbol must resolve at ``import psi4``.

Running
~~~~~~~

GTFock only knows ``MPI_COMM_WORLD``, so MPI has to be up before |PSIfour|
touches it. :py:mod:`psi4.driver.gtfock` does that by importing mpi4py, and then
cross-checks that mpi4py and |PSIfours| linked MPI agree on rank and size |w---w|
if the two were bound to different MPI libraries, it raises instead of running
on a broken communicator.

.. code-block:: python

    # scf_gtfock.py
    import psi4
    from psi4.driver import gtfock

    info = gtfock.initialize()           # imports mpi4py; MPI_Init happens here
    psi4.core.set_output_file(f"out.rank{info['rank']}", False)

    psi4.geometry("""
    O
    H 1 0.96
    H 1 0.96 2 104.5
    """)
    psi4.set_options({"basis": "sto-3g", "puream": False, "scf_type": "gtfock"})
    energy = psi4.energy("scf")

    assert psi4.core.gtfock_fock_builds() > 0   # GTFock really ran

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> eval $(objdir_gtfock/stage/bin/psi4 --psiapi)
    >>> OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -n 2 python scf_gtfock.py

Every rank runs the whole |PSIfour| driver and calls the same collective GTFock
routines; GTFock partitions the J/K work and each rank ends up with identical
matrices. Keep ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` modest when oversubscribing a test machine.

Introspection helpers, all usable without mpi4py:

* :py:func:`psi4.core.gtfock_enabled` |w---w| was |PSIfour| compiled with GTFock
* :py:func:`psi4.core.gtfock_fock_builds` |w---w| GTFock Fock builds this process
  ran; ``0`` after a calculation means it fell back to |PSIfours| own integrals
* :py:func:`psi4.core.gtfock_world_rank` / ``gtfock_world_size`` |w---w|
  ``MPI_COMM_WORLD`` as |PSIfours| linked MPI sees it
* :py:func:`psi4.core.gtfock_process_grid` / ``gtfock_local_block`` |w---w| the
  process grid and the AO block GTFock gave this rank

Testing
~~~~~~~

:source:`tests/pytests/test_gtfock.py` covers the opt-in path and skips cleanly
when GTFock is absent, except for the optionality guard, which always runs:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> pytest -v tests/pytests/test_gtfock.py

The multi-rank case launches :source:`tests/pytests/gtfock_mpi_driver.py` under
``mpirun -n 2`` and asserts per-rank evidence: mpi4py and |PSIfours| MPI agree,
each rank owns a distinct AO block, ``jk.name()`` is ``GTFockJK``, GTFock's Fock
build counter advanced, and the RHF energy matches |PSIfours| own PK result.

How to configure GTFock for building Psi4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Role and Dependencies**

* Role |w---w| In |PSIfour|, GTFock provides an MPI-distributed J/K builder
  selected by :term:`SCF_TYPE <SCF_TYPE (SCF)>` ``GTFOCK``.

* Downstream Dependencies |w---w| |PSIfour| (\ |dr| optional) GTFock

* Upstream Dependencies |w---w| GTFock |dr| Simint, MPI, OpenMP; and mpi4py at
  runtime

**CMake Variables**

* :makevar:`ENABLE_GTFock` |w---w| CMake variable toggling whether |PSIfour|
  builds with GTFock. Default ``OFF``.
* :makevar:`GTFock_ROOT` |w---w| CMake variable to specify where the pre-built
  GTFock can be found. Set to the installation directory containing
  ``include/pfock.h`` and ``lib/libgtfock.so``.
* :makevar:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` |w---w| must also contain that prefix, since
  Simint is detected from it.

There is no internal build: GTFock has no conda package and no CMake package
config, so |PSIfour| only ever links a GTFock you built yourself.

**Examples**

A. Build *without* GTFock (default)

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake

B. Link against pre-built

  .. code-block:: bash

    >>> cmake -DENABLE_GTFock=ON -DGTFock_ROOT=/path/to/gtfock_psi4/_install \
    ...       -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/gtfock_psi4/_install
